:man_technologist: You can currently find me coding either the [@Coursera](https://github.com/Coursera) webpage, [@Linguistic](https://github.com/Linguistic), or [@entrylvl](https://github.com/Nickersoft/entrylvl). Previously I've worked at [@edX](https://github.com/edX), [@Udacity](https://github.com/Udacity), and [@KAYAK](https://github.com/KAYAK).

:rocket: People typically know me from my work on [PushJS](https://pushjs.org), as well as [the 50+ public Spotify playlists I've created and maintain](https://open.spotify.com/user/tjnickerson) (yes, I'm serious).

:memo: I've written for [@LogRocket](https://github.com/logrocket), as well as [.net Magazine](https://www.creativebloq.com/net-magazine) in the UK!

:cn: I've been an avid learning of Mandarin for most of my life and am a language geek, as you might have guessed :grin:
